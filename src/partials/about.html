          We treat the production of our ice cream with great love and excitement, 
          which is why we make it exclusively from natural selected milk. 
        </p>
        <p class="about-wrap__secondary-text">
          Our cows give delicious milk. The best conditions have been created for them:
          pastures in the fresh air with juicy grass and healthy feed, 
          care and regular medical examinations.
          Everything is only the best, so that you can later enjoy not only a tasty, 
          but also a healthy product.
